# RomCom 


### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)


We created an application which allows you to generate, save and create your own romantic novel covers. This app makes it easy to keep track of your favorite covers and allows you to express your creativity and execute your own cover ideas, while drawing inspiration from previously generated covers.


### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)




1. Copy repository SSH link.
2. Run `git clone`  followed by the SSH link in your terminal.
3. Move into the romcom directory using the `cd` command in your terminal.
4. Once in the romcom directory, run `open index.html` and our app will appear in your browser!


### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
 This 'Make Your Own Cover' component will allow you to create your own romantic novel cover! Fill out the given form and your self made cover will be generated with the click of the 'make my cover' button. Once your cover is generated, you will be given the option to save it to your 'saved cover' collection!

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We've created this application while in the midst of the beginning stages of the Turing Front End program. While only two weeks into mod 1 and with the given knowledge and resources, this application took us about three days to complete, involving a significant amount of team work and learning.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
1. Write clean, DRY JavaScript
   - Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
   - Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
2. Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
   - Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
3. Write code collaboratively
   - Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
   - Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
   - Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)




**Wins**


- We learned how to collaboratively
   make effective decisions and write working code while avoiding undproductive struggle
- Throughout this project we've also had the opportunity to grow comfortable with the git workflow process 


**Challenges**


- We often ran into issues with github towards the beginning of the project but were able to reach out and develop a better understanding of the git workflow process after spotting our mistakes
- We also ran into the issue of needing to add to our understanding and skill set to successfully fulfill and complete each iteration. In turn, this gave us the opportunity to expand on our learning and develop a greater knowledge and understanding of various topics relating to the interactions of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
